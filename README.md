# mps_toolbox: Toolbox for Multipoint statistics [WIP]

This is a python3 project providing tools for analysing multipoint statistics outputs.
It is under construction.

Currently an example for evaluating the connectivity function in x direction is provided:
`python3 example.py`
Three windows with connectivity functions for each facies of the `ti_categoricalSoilCracks.txt` image should be displayed.

The image is a 2D image 550 by 500 and saved in a text file as a simple column vector.
